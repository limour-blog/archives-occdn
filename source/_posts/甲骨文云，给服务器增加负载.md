Idle Always Free compute instances may be reclaimed by Oracle. Oracle will deem virtual machine and bare metal compute instances as idle if, during a 7-day period, the following are true:

CPU utilization for the 95th percentile is less than 10%  
Network utilization is less than 10%  
Memory utilization is less than 10% (applies to A1 shapes only)

[Idle Always Free](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm)计算实例可能会被 Oracle 回收。
